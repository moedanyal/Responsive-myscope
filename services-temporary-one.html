  <h2 class="more-h2"> <a id="student-visa"STUDENT VISA> STUDENT VISA </a></h2>  
<p>Canada is famous for its high quality education and living standards. Many students choose to come to Canadian universities and educational institutions to take advantage of our world-class educational system. <BR>

    A study permit is a legal document that allows an international student to study in Canada for a specific time period. Excluding some exceptions, most international students need a study permit to study in Canada, if the length of your program of study is more than 6 months. A Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) might also be required to enter Canada, but this depends on your country or residence or citizenship. <br>
    
    While on a study permit in Canada, it is important that you understand the conditions of your study permit. Failure to satisfy your study permit conditions can result in losing your status as a student and may force you to exit Canada. <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>
       <u> REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDY PERMIT IN CANADA</u>
         </strong>
</p>
<p>To qualify for a study permit, you will have to meet the following requirements according to Immigration Canada: <br>
    </p>
<p>
    &check;	 <em>Obtain and provide your letter of acceptance from the designated learning institution (DLI) that you have been accepted into.</em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Convince the immigration officer that you will in fact exit Canada upon the conclusion of your studies.</em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Valid passport – ensuring that it is valid throughout the duration of your stay.</em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Evidence the fact that you are financially capable of paying your tuition fees, covering your room and board expenses, as well as your day to day living expenses for the entirety of your stay. </em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Not be inadmissible under criminality grounds pursuant to IRCC provisions. </em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Not pose a risk to the safety and security of Canada or its civilians. </em> <br>
    &check;	<em>Not be inadmissible under medical grounds (you may have to undergo a medical examination).</em> <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
<u id="post-study">WORKING WHILE STUDYING IN CANADA</u>
         </strong>
</p>
<p>
    So long as students maintain a valid study permit and are enrolled as full-time students, they are eligible to work part-time, for up to 20 hours per week during the semester and on a full-time basis during scheduled breaks (e.g. summer break, winter holiday). A valid Social Insurance Number (SIN) is also required. <br>
    Upon completion of their studies, students may also be eligible to apply for a Post-Graduate Work Permit, which allows students to work in Canada for up to 3 years, depending on the length of the study program. <br>
    Note: once your study permit has expired and/or you are no longer attending full-time classes, you can no longer continue working. <br>
    <br>
</p>


<p>
    <strong>
        <u>STUDYING IN CANADA WITHOUT A STUDY PERMIT</u>
         </strong>
</p>

<p>
    It is allowed, but only in specific situations, as under: <br>

    <strong>Minor Children: </strong> <br>
    <strong>Parents with Minor Children: </strong> <br>

    <strong>Refugees and Refugee Claimants: </strong> <br>
    If you are a minor child and are inside Canada as a refugee or refugee claimant, you are exempt from obtaining a study permit inside Canada. This exception also applies if you are a minor child and your parents are inside Canada as refugees or refugee claimants.

    <h2 class="more-h2" id= "work-permit">WORK PERMIT</h2>  
<p><strong>INSIDE CANADA, OUTSIDE CANADA, POST GRADUATION WORK PERMIT, LMIA BASED WORK PERMIT, TEMPORARY RESIDENT PERMIT </strong>
    
    </p>
<p>
    Because of its competitive wages, high workplace safety standards, and numerous professional growth opportunities, Canada welcomes large numbers of foreign workers every year.
In most cases, a work permit is required for foreign nationals to work in Canada.
	 	.
Work Permits are often the first step towards your goals and getting it right from the first time is indispensable for your future.

</p>
<p>As with all applications, specific conditions, eligibility criteria and some restrictions apply to each of the above mentioned categories. <br> <br>
</p>
<p> <strong><u>There are mainly 2 types of Work Permits: </u></strong> <br><br>
    <em>	Open Work Permit </em><br>
    <em>	Closed Work Permit</em>
    </p><br>
<p>
 <strong> CLOSED WORK PERMITS </strong> <br>
    Closed work permits only allows you to work for a specific employer. For many applicants, they require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Without a positive LMIA, the employer will not be able to offer you a job, even if you are qualified. This means that the employer must prove that there is no Canadian citizen or permanent resident available to do the job which is being offered to a Temporary Foreign Worker. <br>
    The success of a closed work permit application depends on many factors, such as: <br>
    Your application must include convincing evidence that you have the required experience, skills & knowledge to perform the job duties outlined in your Job letter. <br>
    The Job Letter should have a detailed list of duties you will perform, your compensation, and the length of time you will be working (both hours and total period). <br><br>
  </p>
<p> <strong>OPEN WORK PERMITS </strong> <br>
    Unlike a closed (or employer-specific) work permit, which strictly limits you to a particular employer, an open work permit allows you the freedom to work almost anywhere in Canada. It allows you to work for any employer in Canada, except for those who have failed to comply with the employment standards or who engage in sex trade such as strip clubs, escort services, or erotic massage parlours. <br>
    You do not need a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) and you do not need a job offer.
    <br> <br>
  </p>
 <strong><u> <h1> WHO QUALIFIES FOR AN OPEN WORK PERMIT? </h1> </u> </strong>
<p> <br>
  <strong>  PERMANENT RESIDENCY APPLICANTS</strong> <br>
    If you have submitted your permanent residency application and are waiting for the results, you may apply for a <em>Bridging Open Work Permit</em>. <br> Your spouse also qualifies for an <em>Open Spousal Work Permit</em>
    </p> <br>
<p>
 <strong>    SPOUSE OF WORKER OR STUDENT </strong> <br>
If your spouse is currently on a study permit or work permit, you may automatically qualify for an open spousal work permit. This open work permit would be connected to your spouse’s visa.
</p> <br>
<p>
<strong>  INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS </strong> <br>
    If you recently graduated from a designated Canadian post-secondary institution, you may be eligible for a Post Graduate Work Permit, which is also an open work permit. Post-graduate work permits are only given to those who you apply within 180 days of receiving your final grades. <br>
    The validity of your post-graduate work permit and depends on the length of your study program. The maximum length is 3 years. <br>
    Note:  A Post-Graduate Work Permit cannot be renewed. 
    <br><br>
</p>
<p>
 <strong> REFUGEES, REFUGEE CLAIMANTS, AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS </strong> <br> <br>

     <strong>VULNERABLE WORKERS EXPERIENCING ABUSE FORM THEIR EMPLOYER </strong> <br> <br>
    
     <strong>WORKERS IN AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT (EX. WORKING HOLIDAY VISA) </strong> <br>
    The working holiday visa program allows young persons aged 18 – 35 years old to apply for a 1-year open work permit. This specific program applies only to certain countries who have made an international agreement with Canada. <br> <br>
    </p>
<p>
    <strong> <u>WORK PERMIT EXTENSIONS </u> </strong> <br><br>
    As with all work permits, there is an expiration date. You must either stop working on that date or apply for an extension before expiration. <br>
    Once you have applied for an extension, you have <em> implied status </em>, and can continue working until a decision is made. <br>
    NOTE: Some open work permits cannot be renewed, such as a Post-Graduate Work Permit. The validity of your passport may also limit the length of your work permit.
