</div>

<section class="permanent-pathways">
<div class="expressentry-permanent">
<h2 class="more-h2">Express Entry</h2>
<p>Canada welcomes approximately 400,000 new immigrants every year. 
    Express Entry is a selection process through which IRCC selects Candidates for Permanent Residence in Canada. All applicants make an expression of interest and are entered into a pool of applications. Highest ranked Candidates are invited to apply for Permanent Residence via regular draws. This is one of the fastest ways for immigrating to Canada directly as a permanent resident, if you qualify. Applicants receive points for factors like: Age, Education, Language, Work Experience, and Adaptability etc.
    NOTE: Please note that Express Entry applications are much more than creating an initial profile. It is a crucial stage and missing, incomplete or wrong information or inability to provide required documents after receiving an Invitation to Apply, can not only lead to a refusal, but can also jeopardize your chances for permanent residence in future. We can guide you through the complex maze of the process including guiding you how to obtain a provincial nomination and use it for additional points for your Express Entry.

    <h2 class="perm">Federal Skill Worker <br> Class / FSW</h2>
    <p class="paras  text" >This stream allows professionals and skilled workers to obtain Canadian permanent resident status for themselves and their families.  You may be eligible if you have enough funds for settlement in Canada; evidence of an approved test of required language competency in English and/French; evidence of completion of secondary (high school) education or a foreign equivalent. Your education outside Canada must be assessed to determine the Canadian equivalent to be awarded points on your Express Entry profile. This is done by obtaining an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA); you must demonstrate evidence of paid full-time work experience of at least 12 months (or an equal amount of paid part time work) within last 10 years in the same occupation. This experience must be in one of the eligible NOC (Canadian National Occupational classification) categories. Your job duties should accurately reflect the job duties listed in the NOC code.
        To be eligible for the FSW program, you must score at least 67 / 100 points calculator. Only those with 67 points or above will be put in the FSW Express Entry pool.
        Note: This point system is not based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) used in ranking all Express Entry profiles.

  <h2 class="more-h2">PROVINCIAL NOMINEE PROGRAMS(PNP): PROGRAMS BY PROVINCE/ TERRITORY</h2>  
<p>PNP is one of the most important and popular programs to gain permanent residence of Canada. The PNP program is very often considered an alternate to the federal skilled worker program and has its advantages.

    To encourage immigration and to meet labour shortage, each province nominates individuals based on work skills, experience and education to improve its economy. Each province has its own programs and selection criteria.
    Almost all provinces in Canada have an agreement with the Government of Canada that allows them to nominate applicants for permanent residency.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>
        	British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program <BR>
        	Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program <br>
        	Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program-NOVA SCOTIA, NEW BRUNSWICK, PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, NEWFOUNDLAND & LABRADOR <br>
        	Alberta Provincial Nominee program <br>
         </strong>
</p>
<p>NOTE: Requirements can change over time, and streams can be opened or closed without warning by the province.
    If the stream is through Express Entry, you must create an IRCC profile and show you are interested in settling in that province to receive nomination. Find out more about <a href="#"> Express Entry</a>
